Football Predictions Project
Overview
This project is a web application that predicts the outcome of football matches using a machine learning model. The application allows users to input the names of the home and away teams, and it returns a prediction of the match outcome (Home Win or Away Win). Additionally, the application fetches and displays the last 5 matches of a specified team using an external football data API.

The project is built using ASP.NET Core for the backend, and it integrates a Python script for machine learning predictions. The frontend is a simple HTML page with JavaScript for handling user interactions and displaying results.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:

Backend (ASP.NET Core)
.NET 6 SDK or later

ASP.NET Core runtime

HttpClient for making API requests

JSON support for configuration and data serialization

Frontend
Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

JavaScript enabled

Python (for Machine Learning)
Python 3.8 or later

Required Python libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

joblib

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
External API
API key from Football-Data.org

Base URL for the API: https://api.football-data.org/v4/

Setup
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/football-predictions.git
cd football-predictions
Configure the API settings:

Run the ASP.NET Core application:
dotnet run

Usage
Predict Match Outcome:

Enter the names of the home and away teams in the input fields.

Click the "Predict" button to get the predicted outcome.

Future Plans
This project is continuously being developed, and the following features are planned for future releases:

Support for More Leagues: Currently, the model is trained on data from the English Premier League. We plan to add support for more leagues in the future.

External API Integration: We plan to enhance the application by integrating an external API to fetch and display more detailed statistics and recent matches for selected teams.

Improved Machine Learning Model: We aim to improve the accuracy of the predictions by incorporating more features and using more advanced machine learning techniques.

User Interface Enhancements: The frontend will be improved to provide a more user-friendly experience, including better visualization of match statistics and predictions.
