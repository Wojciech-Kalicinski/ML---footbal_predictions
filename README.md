Football Predictions Project

Overview
This project is a web application that predicts the outcome of football matches using a machine learning model. The application allows me to input the names of the home and away teams, and it returns a prediction of the match outcome (Home Win or Away Win). Additionally, the application fetches and displays the last 5 matches of a specified team using an external football data API.

The project is built using ASP.NET Core for the backend, and I integrate a Python script for machine learning predictions. The frontend is a simple HTML page with JavaScript for handling user interactions and displaying results.

Requirements
To run this project, I need the following:

Backend (ASP.NET Core)

.NET 6 SDK or later
ASP.NET Core runtime
HttpClient for making API requests
JSON support for configuration and data serialization
Frontend

Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
JavaScript enabled
Python (for Machine Learning)

Python 3.8 or later
Required Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
joblib
I can install the required Python libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib

Setup

1.Clone the repository
2. Run the ASP.NET Core application



Usage
Predict Match Outcome:

I can enter the names of the home and away teams in the input fields.
I click the "Predict" button to get the predicted outcome.
Future Plans
This project is continuously being developed, and I have the following features planned for future releases:

Support for More Leagues: Currently, the model is trained on data from the English Premier League. I plan to add support for more leagues in the future.
External API Integration: I plan to enhance the application by integrating an external API to fetch and display more detailed statistics and recent matches for selected teams.
Improved Machine Learning Model: I aim to improve the accuracy of the predictions by incorporating more features and using more advanced machine learning techniques.
User Interface Enhancements: The frontend will be improved to provide a more user-friendly experience, including better visualization of match statistics and predictions.
Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If I have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests, I can open an issue or submit a pull request.
