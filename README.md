Overview
This is a web application that predicts football match outcomes using a machine learning model. Simply enter the home and away team names, and the app will predict the result: Home Win 🏠 or Away Win ⚽.

The backend is built with ASP.NET Core, while Python handles the machine learning predictions. The frontend is a simple HTML page with JavaScript for user interaction.
